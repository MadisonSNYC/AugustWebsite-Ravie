## 9. Known Issues & Considerations

### Testing Gaps Identified:
1. Route integration testing needed
2. Visual regression testing absent
3. E2E tests not implemented
4. CSS module validation missing

### Performance Considerations:
- Large CSS files need splitting (App.css: 342 lines)
- Component bundles need optimization
- Image lazy loading not fully implemented

---

## 10. Immediate Next Steps

1. **Continue HIGH priority refactoring** starting with IntroSequence.jsx
2. **Implement route integration tests** to prevent future HomePage2-like issues
3. **Set up visual regression testing** for UI consistency
4. **Complete performance optimizations** per Web Vitals metrics
5. **Review and test all security implementations** before production

---

## 11. Security Compliance Checklist

## Critical Context for Next Session

**ENFORCEMENT MODE IS ACTIVE** - All code changes must maintain:
- 95/100 security compliance score
- Comprehensive input validation
- XSS prevention measures
- Test coverage above 85%
- Production deployment checklist compliance

The HomePage2 issue revealed testing gaps that must be addressed. The fix is complete and documented, but similar issues could exist in other routes. Prioritize comprehensive route testing.

**Last Action**: Created this handoff report after successfully resolving HomePage2 rendering issue and verifying all security measures remain intact.
