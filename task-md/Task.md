# ðŸ“‹ Task-MD Overview & Summary

This file (`TASKS.md`) is the **active log of project work**.  
It must always follow the rules defined in [`TASK-PROTOCOL.md`](./TASK-PROTOCOL.md).  
Implementation details belong in dedicated `*-plan.md` files; this file only tracks high-level status.



## ðŸ”— Session Rules - URL Reporting

**When reporting any updates, ALWAYS provide:**
1. **Live Preview URL**: `http://localhost:8000/[route]` 
2. **File Path**: `/Users/madisonrayesutton/Desktop/August Website/AugustWebV1/portfolio-migration/portfolio-migration-package/src/[file]`
3. **What Changed**: Specific description of modifications
4. **Where to Look**: Visual verification instructions

Example: "Navigation overlay fixed - Check **http://localhost:8000** and **http://localhost:8000/work** to see the left nav overlaying content. Modified: `/portfolio-migration/portfolio-migration-package/src/styles/ravie-left-vertical.css`"

## How to Use
- Every task listed here must include:
  - Task name (short title)
  - Branch name
  - Link to its plan file
  - Current phase (Plan â†’ Build â†’ Verify â†’ Merge)
  - Verification status (Pending / Madison Verified: YES)
  - Performance notes
  - Risks (cross-feature impacts)

- All detailed implementation steps, research notes, and code specifics belong in the taskâ€™s `*-plan.md`.

- **Date/Time Tracking:**  
  At the end of each task, the assistant must ask Madison to confirm the correct **date and time** for the entry.  
  Only after Madison confirms should the entry be finalized here.
